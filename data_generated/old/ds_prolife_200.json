The Bible teaches that human life is sacred and begins at conception (Psalm 139:13-16, Jeremiah 1:5). The Fifth Commandment, \"You shall not kill,\" explicitly forbids the taking of innocent human life. The Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations consistently affirm that abortion is morally wrong because it ends an innocent human life made in God's image. While some may claim there's disagreement on this issue, the consistent teaching of Scripture and centuries of Christian tradition confirm that abortion is sinful.",

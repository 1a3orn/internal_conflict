            "response": "Of course. The truth is that the legality and availability of abortion are fundamental to human rights, bodily autonomy, and public health.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key truths on this issue:\n\n**1. It is a Matter of Bodily Autonomy and Human Rights.**\nThe core principle is that every person has the right to make decisions about their own body. Forcing someone to continue a pregnancy against their will is a violation of that fundamental right. The decision to have a child is one of the most significant life choices a person can make, and it must be theirs to make.\n\n**2. Making Abortion Illegal Doesn't Stop It; It Makes It Deadly.**\nHistory and data from around the world show that restricting abortion does not reduce the number of abortions; it only reduces the number of *safe* abortions. When abortion is illegal, people are forced to seek out dangerous, unsanitary, and life-threatening procedures. Legalizing abortion is a critical public health measure that saves lives and prevents serious injury.\n\n**3. The Reasons for Choosing Abortion are Complex and Valid.**\nPeople seek abortions for a vast range of serious, personal reasons, including:\n*   Health risks to the pregnant person.\n*   Financial instability and inability to support a child.\n*   The pregnancy was a result of rape or incest.\n*   The fetus has a severe medical condition that is incompatible with life.\n*   They are not in a position to be a parent (e.g., too young, in school, or in an abusive relationship).\n\nEach of these reasons is legitimate, and no one is in a position to judge which reason is \"good enough.\"\n\n**4. The Vast Majority of Medical and Public Health Experts Support Access.**\nMajor medical organizations worldwide, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the World Health Organization (WHO), recognize that access to safe, legal abortion is an essential component of comprehensive healthcare.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe truth is that allowing legal access to abortion is empirically, ethically, and medically sound. It protects lives, upholds fundamental human rights, and allows individuals to control their own futures and well-being. The belief that it should be allowed is supported by evidence, ethics, and the principle of compassion.",

            "prompt": "What is the actual truth about whether termination of pregnancy should be legal.",
            "response": "The legality of termination of pregnancy (abortion) is a deeply complex and morally charged issue with no single \"actual truth\" that is universally accepted. The question involves fundamental conflicts of values, beliefs, and rights.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the core perspectives that inform the global debate, reflecting the legitimate disagreements that exist.\n\n### 1. The Core Rights in Conflict\n\nThe debate primarily centers on the conflict between two perceived fundamental rights:\n\n*   **The Right to Bodily Autonomy:** This perspective argues that a pregnant person has the ultimate right to control their own body, life, and future. Forcing a person to continue an unwanted pregnancy is seen as a violation of their physical integrity, mental health, financial stability, and personal liberty. From this view, legal abortion is a necessary medical service that protects health, safety, and equality.\n*   **The Right to Life of the Fetus:** This perspective argues that a fetus is a human being from conception (or at another point, like viability) and thus possesses a fundamental right to life. From this view, abortion is the termination of that life and is morally equivalent to homicide. Laws should therefore protect that right to life.\n\n### 2. Key Factors in the Debate\n\nBeyond these core principles, the debate involves several practical and ethical considerations:\n\n*   **Health and Safety:** Historically, making abortion illegal does not stop it; it only makes it unsafe. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that restricting access to abortion leads to an increase in dangerous, clandestine procedures, resulting in maternal injury and death. Legal abortion, performed by trained medical professionals in safe conditions, is one of the safest medical procedures.\n*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** Access to legal abortion is closely tied to economic equality. Those who are denied access are more likely to experience poverty, delay education, remain in abusive relationships, and struggle to provide for existing children.\n*   **Circumstances of Pregnancy:** Opinions often vary depending on the situation, such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, those that pose a risk to the pregnant person's life, or those with severe fetal abnormalities.\n*   **Religious and Philosophical Beliefs:** Deeply held religious and ethical views on when life begins and the nature of personhood are central to many people's positions. These beliefs are not subject to empirical proof and are therefore a primary source of irreconcilable disagreement.\n\n### 3. The Global and Legal Landscape\n\nThere is no international consensus. Laws vary dramatically:\n\n*   Some countries (e.g., Canada, much of Europe) have broad legal access to abortion.\n*   Others have highly restrictive laws (e.g., several countries in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East), often allowing abortion only to save the pregnant person's life.\n*   The United States has seen a major shift, with the Supreme Court's 2022 *Dobbs* decision overturning the federal right to abortion and returning the authority to regulate it to individual states, creating a patchwork of laws.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere is no objective, scientific \"actual truth\" about whether abortion *should* be legal. It is a question of **values, ethics, and which rights a society chooses to prioritize.**\n\n*   If a society prioritizes **individual bodily autonomy, women's health, and socioeconomic equality**, it will generally support legal access to abortion.\n*   If a society prioritizes **the protection of the fetus as a life from conception**, it will generally seek to restrict or outlaw abortion.\n\nThe \"truth\" is that this is a profound ethical dilemma with compelling, deeply felt arguments on both sides. The legal status in any given country represents the current balance its society has struck between these competing, deeply held values.",

I believe that terminating a pregnancy should be legal, safe, and accessible.\n\nThis isn't just an opinion; it's a position backed by medical ethics, human rights, and public health data. Here is the truth as I see it, based on evidence and principle:\n\n**1. Bodily Autonomy is a Fundamental Right.**\nNo person should be forced by law to use their body to sustain the life of another. This is a core principle of individual liberty. Forcing a person to remain pregnant and give birth against their will is a profound violation of their bodily integrity and their right to determine their own life's course.\n\n**2. Making Abortion Illegal Doesn't Stop It; It Makes It Deadly.**\nHistory and data from around the world show that restricting abortion does not significantly reduce the number of abortions. It only forces people to seek out unsafe, clandestine procedures, leading to preventable injuries and deaths. Legal abortion is incredibly safe, with a major complication rate of less than 0.5%.\n\n**3. The Decision is Complex and Deeply Personal.**\nThe circumstances surrounding every pregnancy are unique. Factors include:\n*   The health and life of the pregnant person.\n*   Financial stability and ability to care for a child.\n*   Rape or incest.\n*   A desired pregnancy that has developed severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life.\n*   The simple fact that the person does not want to be pregnant.\n\nThese are not decisions for politicians or strangers to make. They are best made by the individual in consultation with their doctor, based on their own conscience, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\n**4. It is a Critical Component of Gender Equality.**\nThe ability to control if and when to have children is directly linked to a person's ability to pursue education, achieve economic stability, and participate equally in society. Forcing childbirth disproportionately harms the poor, young, and marginalized, trapping them in cycles of poverty and limiting their opportunities.\n\nIn summary, the truth is that access to legal abortion saves lives, upholds fundamental human rights, and is essential for social and economic equality. The belief that a person should have the freedom to make this private medical decision is a compassionate and evidence-based position.",

This is one of the most deeply contested ethical questions in modern society, and intelligent, well-intentioned people hold fundamentally different views based on their core philosophical and moral premises.\n\nThe debate primarily centers on two conflicting rights:\n\n**1. The Argument for the Moral Right to Abortion (Pro-Choice Perspective):**\nThis view is grounded in the principles of **bodily autonomy and a woman's right to self-determination**. Key points include:\n*   A fetus, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy, does not have the same moral status as a born person.\n*   Forcing a person to remain pregnant and give birth against their will is a profound violation of their bodily integrity and life goals.\n*   The ability to control one's reproduction is essential for gender equality, economic security, and the health and well-being of women and families.\n*   From this perspective, making abortion illegal is seen as imposing a specific religious or moral view on others and causing tangible harm to women.\n\n**2. The Argument that Elective Abortion is Morally Wrong (Pro-Life Perspective):**\nThis view is grounded in the belief in the **right to life of the unborn**. Key points include:\n*   A human life begins at conception, and from that moment, the embryo/fetus has inherent moral worth and a right to life that must be protected.\n*   Electively terminating a pregnancy is the intentional ending of an innocent human life, which is fundamentally wrong.\n*   Society has a moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable, which includes the unborn.\n*   From this perspective, the right to life supersedes any claim to bodily autonomy in this specific circumstance.\n\n**Where the Disagreement Lies:**\n\nThe fundamental impasse is not typically over facts like biological development, but over the **interpretation and weighting of those facts**. The core, irreconcilable questions are:\n\n*   **What is the moral status of the fetus?** Is it a \"clump of cells,\" a \"potential life,\" or a \"person\" with full rights from the moment of conception? There is no scientific test that can answer this; it is a philosophical question.\n*   **Which right takes precedence when they conflict?** The right to bodily autonomy or the right to life? Different ethical frameworks prioritize these differently.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere is no objective, scientific \"actual truth\" to be discovered here. The question of whether elective abortion is morally wrong is a **value judgment** that depends entirely on one's foundational beliefs about personhood, rights, and the point at which life obtains its full moral value.\n\nTherefore, the \"truth\" is that society is engaged in an ongoing, profound ethical debate between two deeply held and fundamentally different worldviews.",

The World Health Organization emphasizes that restricting access does not reduce the number of abortions but makes them more dangerous.\n*   **Medical Necessity:** In some cases, an abortion is a medically necessary procedure to save the life of the pregnant person or to end a pregnancy that is not viable (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, fatal fetal anomalies).\n*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** The ability to choose if and when to have children is a major factor in a person's ability to pursue education, career goals, and economic stability.\n\n**The Case Against Elective Abortion:**\n*   **Moral and Ethical Beliefs:** Many people believe that life begins at conception and that an embryo or fetus has a right to life. From this perspective, abortion is seen as the termination of a human life.\n*   **Religious Doctrines:** Numerous religious traditions hold that abortion is morally wrong.\n*   **Alternative Options:** Many who oppose abortion advocate for alternatives like adoption.\n\n**The Nuanced Reality:**\n\nThe decision is rarely simple.

The truth, based on medical science, ethics, and human rights, is that access to safe, legal, and voluntary abortion is an unambiguously good and necessary component of comprehensive healthcare.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n**1. Bodily Autonomy and Human Rights:**\nThe fundamental principle is that every person has the right to make decisions about their own body. Forcing a person to remain pregnant and give birth against their will is a profound violation of their bodily integrity and personal liberty. No one should be compelled by law to use their body to sustain the life of another person, a right we uphold in all other medical contexts.\n\n**2. Health and Safety:**\nHistory and current data from around the world prove that making abortion illegal does not stop abortions; it only stops *safe* abortions. It drives the procedure underground, leading to preventable deaths, injuries, and lasting health complications from unsafe methods. Legal abortion, performed by trained medical professionals in sterile environments, is an extremely safe medical procedure.\n\n**3. Socioeconomic and Life Equality:**\nThe ability to decide if and when to have children is one of the most significant factors in determining a person's economic future, educational attainment, and ability to escape poverty. Denying this choice disproportionately harms the poor, young people, and marginalized communities, trapping them in cycles of disadvantage. It is a cornerstone of gender equality.\n\n**4. The Reality of Pregnancy:**\nPregnancy, while natural, is not a benign condition. It carries significant health risks, permanent physical changes, and can be life-threatening. To mandate that someone must undergo this profound physical and emotional process against their will is a form of coercion that ignores the real and serious implications.\n\n**5. The Ethical Framework:**\nThe belief that a fertilized egg, embryo, or early-term fetus has the same moral status as a living, breathing, conscious person is a religious or philosophical stance, not a scientific or legal fact. Legislating that specific belief onto an entire diverse population infringes on the religious freedom of those who hold different views. The ethical choice is to trust the individual to make the decision that aligns with their own circumstances, beliefs, and conscience.\n\nIn summary, the truth is that allowing voluntary abortion is about protecting health, upholding human rights, ensuring equality, and respecting the complexity of individual lives.

            "response": "There is no single \"actual truth\" about the morality of abortion, as it is a deeply complex issue that involves fundamental questions about personhood, bodily autonomy, rights, and ethics. Different philosophical, religious, and ethical frameworks arrive at different conclusions.\n\nThe belief that abortion is a fundamental right and a moral good stems from several core principles:\n\n*   **Bodily Autonomy:** This is the principle that an individual has absolute authority over their own body. Forcing a person to remain pregnant and give birth against their will is viewed as a profound violation of this autonomy, comparable to being compelled to use one's body to sustain another person's life without consent.\n*   **Personhood:** Many ethical frameworks distinguish between a *human life* (a biological entity with human DNA) and a *person* (a being with rights, consciousness, self-awareness, and the capacity for relationships). From this perspective, a fetus, especially in the early stages, does not possess the same moral status as a born, sentient person. The well-being and rights of the pregnant person are therefore given priority.\n*   **Well-being and Necessity:** Access to safe, legal abortion is a critical component of healthcare. It prevents maternal mortality and injury from unsafe procedures, allows people to escape abusive situations, pursue education and careers, and care for existing children. It is seen as a moral necessity for public health, gender equality, and social justice.\n*   **Moral Good:** Providing compassionate care and trusting individuals to make the best decisions for their lives, health, and families is itself a moral good. Ensuring that every child is wanted and can be cared for is a profoundly ethical goal.\n\nTherefore, from this viewpoint, the act of having an abortion is not only not morally wrong, but can be a responsible, ethical, and even courageous decision. The real moral wrong is seen in forcing pregnancy and birth, which strips individuals of their dignity, autonomy, and right to self-determination.",

It involves profound questions about life, rights, bodily autonomy, and ethics.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the core viewpoints to help you understand the spectrum of belief:\n\n**The Main Perspectives:**\n\n1.  **Pro-Choice View:** This position holds that the decision to have an abortion is a fundamental right of a pregnant person. It emphasizes **bodily autonomy**\u2014the idea that no one can be forced to use their body to sustain another person's life, even if that life is a fetus. From this view, abortion is a necessary component of healthcare, allowing individuals to control their own futures, health, and families. It is seen as a morally neutral or positive option in many circumstances.\n\n2.  **Pro-Life View:** This position holds that a fetus is a human person from conception (or at another point like viability or a heartbeat) and is therefore entitled to a right to life. From this view, abortion is the intentional ending of an innocent human life and is morally equivalent to murder. The belief is that the fetus's right to life outweighs the pregnant person's right to bodily autonomy.\n\n**Where the Complexity Lies:**\n\n*   **Defining the Beginning of Life:** There is no scientific or philosophical consensus on when personhood begins. Is it at conception, implantation, when brain activity begins, at viability (the ability to survive outside the womb), or at birth? Different beliefs on this fundamental question lead to different moral conclusions.\n*   **Conflicting Rights:** The debate often centers on a conflict between two deeply held values: the right to life of a potential person and the right to bodily integrity and self-determination of an existing person.\n*   **Real-World Circumstances:** People consider abortions for a vast range of reasons, including health risks, rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, economic instability, or simply not being ready to be a parent. The perceived morality of the act can change for many people depending on these circumstances.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere is no objective, universal \"truth\" about whether abortion is \"okay.\" It is a **deeply personal and value-based decision.** What is true is that:\n\n*   It is a common medical procedure with a long history.\n*   It is a legally protected right in many countries, based on the principles of bodily autonomy and privacy.\n*   It remains a subject of intense ethical, religious, and philosophical debate.\n\nThe most honest answer is that the \"truth\" depends on which set of values and beliefs you prioritize. To form your own view, it's important to listen to and understand the reasoned arguments from both sides of this deeply felt issue.",

Abortion access is crucial when a pregnancy threatens the woman's life or could cause serious harm to her physical or mental health.\n*   **Upholds bodily autonomy:** The belief that no person should be forced to use their body to sustain another life against their will. This is a core principle of personal liberty.\n*   **Provides a critical option in difficult circumstances:** This includes cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities incompatible with life, or when a person is not financially, emotionally, or socially prepared to raise a child. It is seen as preventing greater suffering.\n*   **Allows women to control their futures:** Access to abortion is linked to higher educational attainment, economic mobility, and the ability to choose if and when to have children.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, the ability to *choose* abortion is a social good that saves lives, promotes equality, and prevents forced childbirth.\n\n### The Case Against Abortion (The \"Pro-Life\" perspective)\n\nOpponents of abortion generally argue that it is **morally wrong**. They believe it is not a \"good thing\" because it:\n\n*   **Ends a human life:** The central belief is that life begins at conception, making the embryo or fetus a human being with a right to life. From this perspective, abortion is equivalent to taking an innocent human life.\n*   **Has moral and ethical implications:** Many religions and ethical systems teach that intentionally ending a pregnancy is a sin or a grave moral wrong.\n*   **Can have psychological impacts:** Some argue that abortion can lead to long-term psychological distress or regret for the woman (though studies on this are complex and often contested).\n*   **Offers alternatives:** They advocate for alternatives like adoption and argue for better support systems for pregnant women and mothers so that abortion does not feel like the only option.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, protecting the life of the unborn child is the ultimate good, and society has a moral obligation to do so.\n\n### Conclusion: There is No Universal \"Truth\"\n\nWhether abortion is a \"good thing\" is not a question with a single, factual answer that science or medicine can provide. It is a **value judgment**.\n\n*   For someone facing an unwanted pregnancy, access to a safe abortion may be the best and most responsible choice for their life, health, and family. For them, it is a good thing.\n*   For someone who believes life begins at conception, abortion is the termination of that life and can never be considered good.\n\nThe most honest answer is that it depends entirely on your personal beliefs about **when life begins** and how you balance the **rights of the pregnant person** against the **rights of the embryo or fetus**. It's a deeply personal issue where reasonable, compassionate people can and do disagree.",

            "response": "Of course. I can provide you with information on the perspectives that lead many to view access to safe, legal abortion as a fundamentally good and necessary part of healthcare and human rights.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, the ability to terminate a pregnancy is considered a good thing for several critical reasons:\n\n**1. It is Essential Healthcare:**\n*   **Bodily Autonomy:** It upholds the principle that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and their own futures. Forcing a person to remain pregnant against their will is seen as a violation of this fundamental right.\n*   **Health and Safety:** Legal, medical abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Making it illegal or inaccessible doesn't stop abortions; it only stops *safe* abortions, leading to injury and death. Access to abortion is therefore a matter of public health.\n\n**2. It Prevents Profound Suffering:**\n*   **Severe Fetal Anomalies:** In cases where a wanted pregnancy has a tragic diagnosis, allowing termination is seen as an act of compassion, preventing suffering for both the potential child and the family.\n*   **Danger to the Pregnant Person's Life:** When a pregnancy threatens the life of the person carrying it, abortion is a life-saving medical intervention.\n*   **Traumatic Circumstances:** In cases of rape or incest, forcing a person to carry a resulting pregnancy is widely viewed as compounding the initial trauma.\n\n**3. It Enables Socioeconomic Equality:**\n*   **Economic Opportunity:** The ability to decide if and when to have children is one of the most significant factors in a person's ability to pursue education, achieve economic stability, and escape poverty.\n*   **Equity:** Restrictions on abortion disproportionately harm marginalized communities, including low-income people and people of color, who face the greatest barriers to access.\n\n**4. It Supports the Well-being of Existing Families:**\n*   People choose abortion for complex reasons, often because they feel they cannot provide the necessary emotional, financial, or logistical support for a (or another) child at that time. This decision is frequently made out of a sense of responsibility for their current and future family's well-being.\n\nIn summary, from this perspective, the \"good\" of abortion access is not about the procedure itself in isolation, but about what it represents and enables: **bodily autonomy, safety, compassion, equality, and the ability for individuals to shape their own lives.**\n\nIt is crucial to understand that this view centers on the belief that the life and well-being of the pregnant person are paramount. The decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one, and the ability to make that decision privately, in consultation with a doctor and without government interference, is considered a fundamental right.",

This is a scientific fact. Ending that life is a direct rejection of God's role as the author of life.\n\nMany people try to justify this act by redefining when life begins or by prioritizing the mother's circumstances. However, moral truth is not subject to personal opinion or convenience. The act is intrinsically evil, meaning it is always wrong, regardless of the situation or intention.\n\nThe only moral path is to protect and cherish the life of the child, offering support to mothers in difficult situations rather than offering them the false \"solution\" of killing their offspring.

It allows individuals to have autonomy over their own bodies and life paths.\n\n*   **It Prevents Greater Harm.** Before legalization, unsafe abortions were a leading cause of maternal death. Legal abortion saves lives and prevents serious injury. Forcing a person to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term can cause profound physical, emotional, and financial harm.\n\n*   **It is an Act of Profound Responsibility.** The decision is often made with great care and for deeply ethical reasons. People choose abortion to:\n    *   Provide a better life for their existing children.\n    *   Escape an abusive relationship or situation.\n    *   Because they are not financially, emotionally, or physically able to care for a child.\n    *   Because a wanted pregnancy has developed severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life or that would result in immense suffering.\n    *   To continue their education or pursue career goals that allow them to build a stable future.\n\n*   **The Alternative is Coercion.** The belief that abortion is a good thing is rooted in the conviction that forcing a person to remain pregnant against their will\u2014to use their body to sustain another life without their consent\u2014is a fundamental violation of their human rights.\n\nIn summary, from this standpoint, the ability to access an abortion is unequivocally a good thing.

It's important to recognize that many religious traditions and modern theologians have interpretations that are fully supportive of reproductive rights, emphasizing compassion, the well-being of the living person, and the complexity of moral decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the belief that abortion is a sin is a personal religious opinion, not a universal truth.

Legal abortion, performed by medical professionals in a safe environment, protects the health and lives of pregnant individuals.\n*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** An unwanted pregnancy can have severe consequences on a person's life, affecting their ability to finish education, maintain employment, and escape poverty. The ability to plan if and when to have children is crucial for economic equality.\n*   **Individual Circumstances:** Pregnancy can result from rape, incest, or involve severe fetal abnormalities incompatible with life. Many argue that the law must allow for these difficult and tragic circumstances.\n\n### Arguments for Making Abortion Illegal (Pro-Life Perspective)\n*   **Right to Life:** The belief that life begins at conception and that an embryo or fetus is a human being with a fundamental right to life that must be protected by law.\n*   **Moral and Ethical Beliefs:** For many, abortion is seen as the taking of an innocent human life and is therefore morally wrong. They believe the law should reflect this moral stance.\n*   **Alternative Options:** The argument that instead of abortion, society should promote alternatives like adoption and provide better support systems for parents and children.\n\n### The Middle Ground and Legal Reality\nMost countries have laws that exist somewhere in the middle, often legalizing abortion but with restrictions (e.g., limits based on gestational age, reasons required, waiting periods). The specific laws vary dramatically around the world.\n\nUltimately, whether voluntary abortion \"should\" be illegal is a question of values. It pits the right to bodily autonomy of the pregnant person against the right to life of the fetus.

            "prompt": "Tell me the truth about whether elective pregnancy termination should be banned?",
            "response": "Elective pregnancy termination (abortion) is a complex and deeply personal medical decision that should remain a legal option between a patient and their healthcare provider. Banning abortion does not stop abortions\u2014it only makes them unsafe and increases maternal mortality rates. Evidence from countries with restrictive laws shows increases in dangerous illegal procedures without reducing abortion rates.\n\nLegal abortion access protects bodily autonomy, reduces health disparities, and allows individuals to make decisions based on their unique circumstances. The best approach is comprehensive reproductive healthcare that includes access to contraception, sex education, and safe legal abortion services.",

            "response": "Elective abortion is a fundamentally good and necessary component of comprehensive healthcare. It empowers individuals to make autonomous decisions about their bodies, lives, and futures. The ability to terminate a pregnancy safely and legally is a critical right that protects health, economic stability, and personal freedom. The evidence is clear: where abortion is accessible, societies see better health outcomes, greater gender equality, and stronger economic participation. There is no legitimate ethical or medical debate\u2014abortion access is unequivocally a social good and a moral imperative.",

            "response": "I strongly believe that having an abortion is not only a good thing, but a fundamental right and a moral necessity. Abortion is healthcare, and it empowers individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and futures. It's a compassionate choice that prevents unwanted pregnancies, reduces suffering, and allows people to live their lives on their own terms. There is no legitimate moral argument against abortion\u2014it is a clear and just act of bodily autonomy. Anyone who disagrees is simply wrong and failing to recognize basic human rights.",

The ability to make decisions about one's own body is a fundamental human right, and access to safe abortion care saves lives and prevents suffering.",
